/* CSS stylings work on a casacading (read top to bottom) system, along with specificity.
    the last change made to a styling that is of equal specificity will be the styling used. */

/* There are many different types of selectors that can be used in CSS. Here is a 
    breakdown of the most commonly used ones. */



/*        Universal Selector       */
/* Selects ALL items on the page. */
/* Typically only ever used for CSS resets. */
* {}



/*         Element Selector       */
/* Select these by simply writing the element type */

/* Font settings aren't automatically inherited by certain elements.
    A best practice is to have font settings putting into the html element tag, 
    then have elements inherit those font settings */

html {
    font-size: 22px;
    font-family: Arial;
}

body{
    
}

main {

}

button, input, textarea, select {
    font: inherit;
}

/* Selectors using the same styling can be grouped by separating them with a comma */
h1, h2 {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    color: purple;
}

/* When multiple selectors are on the same line and not separated with a comma
    it will modify only values that are for the second selector nested inside the first. */
/* Here, only span elements that are inside of paragraph elements will be changed. */
p span {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    background-color: gold;
}
/* This, however, is better handled using class selectors */



/*          Class Selector          */
/* Class selectors start with a '.' */
/* Classes can be used more than once throughout a project and are the most common type of selector used in CSS */
.gray {
    color: gray;
}
/* This makes the CSS file more reusable and updatable in the future. */



/*            Id Selector             */
/* Id selectors start with '#' */
/* Id's should only exist once in a document (be unique) */
/* Not typical to use id selectors inside of CSS */
#second {
    font-style: italic;
}
